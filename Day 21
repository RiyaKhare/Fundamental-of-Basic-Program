//Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

//Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

//Code-
class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        if(haystack.contains(needle)){
            return haystack.indexOf(needle);
        }
    return -1;
    }
}
